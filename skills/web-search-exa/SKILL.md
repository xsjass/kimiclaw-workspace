# Exa — Neural Web Search & Research

Exa is a neural search engine. Unlike keyword-based search, it understands meaning — you describe the page you're looking for and it finds it. Returns clean, LLM-ready content with no scraping needed.

**MCP server:** `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp`
**Free tier:** generous rate limits, no key needed for basic tools
**API key:** [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) — unlocks higher limits + all tools
**Docs:** [exa.ai/docs](https://exa.ai/docs)
**GitHub:** [github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server)

## Setup

Add the MCP server to your agent config:

```bash
# OpenClaw
openclaw mcp add exa --url "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp"
```

Or in any MCP config JSON:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "url": "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

To unlock all tools and remove rate limits, append your API key:
```
https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=YOUR_EXA_KEY
```

To enable specific optional tools:
```

```

Good for when you already have the URL and want to read the page.

---

## deep_researcher_start + deep_researcher_check

Long-running async research. Exa's research agent searches, reads, and compiles a detailed report.

**Start a research task:**
```
deep_researcher_start {
  "query": "competitive landscape of AI code generation tools in 2026 — key players, pricing, technical approaches, market share"
}
```

**Check status (use the researchId from the start response):**
```
deep_researcher_check { "researchId": "abc123..." }
```

Poll `deep_researcher_check` until status is `completed`. The final response includes the full report.

---

## deep_search_exa

Single-call deep search: expands your query across multiple angles, searches, reads results, and returns a synthesized answer with grounded citations. Requires API key.

```
deep_search_exa { "query": "what are the leading approaches to multimodal RAG in production systems" }
```

Supports structured output via `outputSchema`:
```
deep_search_exa {
  "query": "top 10 aerospace companies by revenue",
  "type": "deep",
  "outputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["companies"],
    "properties": {
      "companies": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": { "type": "string" },
            "revenue": { "type": "string" },
            "hq": { "type": "string" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Query Craft

Exa is neural — it matches on meaning, not keywords. Write queries like you'd describe the ideal page to a colleague.

**Do:** "blog post about using embeddings for product recommendations at scale"
**Don't:** "embeddings product recommendations"

**Do:** "Stripe payments company San Francisco fintech"
**Don't:** "Stripe" (too ambiguous)

- Use `category` when you know the content type — it makes a big difference.
- For broader coverage, run 2-3 query variations in parallel and deduplicate results.
- For agentic workflows, use `highlights` instead of full `text` — it's 10x more token-efficient while keeping the relevant parts.

## Token Efficiency

| Content mode | When to use |
|-------------|------------|
| `highlights` | Agent workflows, factual lookups, multi-step pipelines — most token-efficient |
| `text` | Deep analysis, when you need full page context |
| `summary` | Quick overviews, structured extraction with JSON schema |

Set `maxCharacters` on any content mode to control output size.

## When to Reach for Which Tool

| I need to... | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| Quick web lookup | `web_search_exa` |
| Research papers, academic search | `web_search_advanced_exa` + `category: "research paper"` |
| Company intel, competitive analysis | `company_research_exa` or advanced + `category: "company"` |
| Find people, candidates, experts | `people_search_exa` or advanced + `category: "people"` |
| Code examples, API docs | `get_code_context_exa` |
| Read a specific URL | `crawling_exa` |
| Find pages similar to a URL | `web_search_advanced_exa` with URL as query |
| Recent news / tweets | Advanced + `category: "news"` or `"tweet"` + `maxAgeHours` |
| Detailed research report | `deep_researcher_start` → `deep_researcher_check` |
| Quick answer with citations | `deep_search_exa` |
